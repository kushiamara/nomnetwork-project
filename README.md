## About the App
Our app merges the visual excitement of Instagram with the detailed insights of Yelp. Users get to capture and share their food experiences with their friends and followers through posts while also exploring and discovering restaurants tailored to their preferences. This will be done by allowing users to share their culinary adventures but also tag the restaurants they eat at with categories. This tagging system will allow other users to have a more streamlined and customized search for dining. Restaurant profiles on the app allow restaurant managers to create  targeted promotions and real-time engagement, creating a dynamic platform for food lovers and businesses alike. 

This is not just a review app—it's a blend of social sharing and discovery to transform how people find and enjoy their dining experiences.
